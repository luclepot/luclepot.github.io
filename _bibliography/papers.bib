	abstract = {A growing number of weak- and unsupervised machine learning approaches to anomaly detection are being proposed to significantly extend the search program at the Large Hadron Collider and elsewhere. One of the prototypical examples for these methods is the search for resonant new physics, where a bump hunt can be performed in an invariant mass spectrum. A significant challenge to methods that rely entirely on data is that they are susceptible to sculpting artificial bumps from the dependence of the machine learning classifier on the invariant mass. We explore two solutions to this challenge by minimally incorporating simulation into the learning. In particular, we study the robustness of Simulation Assisted Likelihood-free Anomaly Detection (SALAD), one of our recently developed anomaly detection methods, to correlations between the classifier and the invariant mass. Next, we propose a new approach that only uses the simulation for decorrelation but the Classification without Labels (CWoLa) approach for achieving signal sensitivity.},

  it walks through the theoretical and motivational bases of machine learning in physics, culminating in a step-by-step 
  walkthrough in which participants build a basic neural network in Keras and apply it to a trivial particle physics example.
  Implemented via Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab, this workshop was funded by the UM Physics department.},

	abstract = {We present here a method for identifying high-pt beyond the Standard Model (BSM) signals, with no dependence on the expected physics signatures of these models. We do this by constraining our detector data to the expected signal region of a given model and training a deep neural autoencoder to 'recognize' jets belonging to the Standard Model (SM) background data. In this way, our models learn the background signature of SM jets in our signal region. We then evaluate this model on a mixture of SM and BSM jets, flagging jets with a high autoencoder reconstruction error as 'anomalous' or signal jets. This method of searching independently of any physics model is especially useful when the BSM model in question involves particles of unknown mass, branching fraction, etc. This is especially relevant in Dark Matter searches, such as the search for Semi-Visible jets in missing-ET events at the LHC. In these cases, our models are capable of flagging a range of BSM models with different parameters within our signal region, as opposed to a supervised model (such as a Boosted Decision Tree) which is only able to flag the exact signal it was trained on. We show that this technique is a promising method of identifying arbitrary BSM signals to high precision in LHC data.},

  abstract = {A 280 ml liquid hydrogen target has been constructed and tested for the MUSE 
  experiment at PSI to investigate the proton charge radius via simultaneous 
  measurement of elastic muon-proton and elastic electron-proton scattering. 
  To control systematic uncertainties at a sub-percent level, strong 
  constraints were put on the amount of material surrounding the 
  target and on its temperature stability. The target cell wall is 
  made of 120μm-thick Kapton, while the beam entrance and exit windows 
  are made of 125μm-thick aluminized Kapton. The side exit windows 
  are made of Mylar laminated on aramid fabric with an areal density 
  of 368g/m2. The target system was successfully operated during a 
  commissioning run at PSI at the end of 2018. The target temperature 
  was stable at the 0.01 K level. This suggests a density stability at 
  the 0.02% level, which is about a factor of ten better than required.},

  abstract = {The proton radius puzzle is a currently unresolved problem which has intrigued the scientific community, dealing with a 7 σ discrepancy between the proton radii determined from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy and electron scattering measurements. The MUon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) aims to resolve this puzzle by performing the first simultaneous elastic scattering measurements of both electrons and muons on the proton, which will allow the comparison of the radii from the two interactions with reduced systematic uncertainties. The data from this experiment is expected to provide the best test of lepton universality to date. The experiment will take place at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland in 2018. An essential component of the experiment is a liquid hydrogen (LH2) cryotarget system. Our group at the University of Michigan is responsible for the design, fabrication and installation of this system. Here we present our LH2 target cell design and fabrication techniques for successful operation at 20 K and 1 atm, and our computer vision-based target position survey system which will determine the position of the target, installed inside a vacuum chamber, with 0.01 mm or better precision at the height of the liquid hydrogen target and along the beam direction during the experiment.},
