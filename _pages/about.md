I like physics research, data science, music, and going fast down things.

Check out my [research and work projects](/projects/), the [publications & presentations](/publications/) which resulted from them, or my [personal projects](/personal/)!

I'm in the process of applying for **PHD programs in high energy particle physics**. My background in both physics research and data science makes me well suited to contribute to collaborations across a wide variety of physical science disciplines.
