I like physics research, data science work, music, and going fast downhill.

I'm in the process of applying for graduate schools with the intention of pursuing a PHD in high-energy particle physics. I hope to use my dual backgrounds in physics research and machine learning to contribute to collaborations across a wide variety of physical science disciplines.

Feel free to check out my [research projects](/projects/), the [publications & presentations](/publications/) which resulted from them, or my [personal projects](/personal/).
