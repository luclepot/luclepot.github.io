I like physics research, data science, music, and going fast down things.

Included in this website is my [**research and work projects**](/projects/), the [**publications & presentations**](/publications/) which resulted from them, and some [**personal projects**](/personal/).

I'm in the process of applying for **PHD programs in high energy particle physics**. My background in both physics research and data science makes me well suited to contribute to collaborations across a wide variety of physical science disciplines.
