## about

Linder house is a student cooperative within the [ICC](https://icc.coop/), home to about 20-25 house members (those who live there) and boarders (those who live elsewhere, but eat meals at linder).

At co-op houses, members meet regularly (1-2 times per month) to make decisions about life in the house. We all contribute 4 hours of chores per week, which results in 

* cooking meals for one another every night
* buying all of our food in bulk (much cheaper!!)
* regular bathroom and common space cleaning
* frequent social events

Living with a large, rotating group of people can be hard sometimes, as it necessitates a degree of compromise -- the whole house will never agree on the best temperature for the thermostat, for instance. That being said, I truly love living in a group setting, as it has made me a much more compassionate, social, and collaborative person on the whole. I think this is also true of many of my friends (many of whom I have seen grow personally via co-op living).

## responsibilities

As a president of the house, I am responsible mainly for **facilitation of meetings**, **resolution of conflict between members**, **communication** with the central co-op governing bodies, and many day-to-day **house operations**. I do these things with my wonderful co-president and friend Shani :-)

</div>

With the advent of COVID-19, our job has become somewhat more difficult. Paying attention to and resolving conflicts about COVID policy and having much more frequent meetings to modify said policies has become an important part of the house's routine.

This work generally takes anywhere from 2-6 hours per week -- averaging towards the high end, as of late. Though it has only been ~3 months, I can say concretely that this job makes a person at once more tired, more empathetic, more patient, and more considerate of how their actions might impact others. Overall, it has certainly changed both Shani and I for the better.

## house video

Around september 2020, Shani and I were asked to make a video to give a tour of our house (in lieu of physical tours). Other house members took interest in helping, so we delegated the task to the two most excited (and overly-qualified) people, Kavin and Aiden. 

They did an absolutely **amazing** job, and basically filmed a series of super short sitcom shots. I helped with some of the music, writing a half dozen short tracks (half of which were used).

The full set of tracks and completed video are below :-)

<!-- 
Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: project
    description: a project with a background image
    img: /assets/img/12.jpg
    ---

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/3.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
``` -->
